For web:
*filtering of who can only see the uploaded modules per professor
*can't see the filtered general reports of attendance per subject/class
	-all of the data of students with their results are shown in the "see attendance" even they're not in the same class
*when editing a specific class, once edited the name of it isn't changing in the modules table

For app:
*can't proceed to the MainActivity after logging in
*Class is faulty
	-can't add another class
	-Class->(specific class)->"see attendance"-> only one student was shown even if it has more than 1 student
	-Class->(specific class)->"see attendance"->only one date was shown in the drop down menu
	-Class->(specific class)->"edit class"->nothing happened once edited
*automatic log out once 'back' was press
